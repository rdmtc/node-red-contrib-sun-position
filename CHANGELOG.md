# node-red-contrib-sun-position

## Installation

### Install of a specific Version in Node-Red

- change to the installation directory of Node-Red
- enter the command `npm install node-red-contrib-sun-position@2.0.0`

### Install of a specific Version in Redmatic (on a Homematic)

- logon per ssh
- enter the commands in the order:
  - `source /usr/local/addons/redmatic/home/.profile`
  - `cd /usr/local/addons/redmatic/var`
  - `npm install --save --no-package-lock --global-style --save-prefix="~" --production node-red-contrib-sun-position@2.0.0`

### Install of a specific Version in HomeAssistant

- go to the Supervisor
- go to the Node-Red AddOn
- stop the Node-Red AddOn
- edit `config/node-red/package.json` and remove the line with `node-red-contrib-sun-position`
- add unter the `Configuration` in the Node-Red options as `npm_packages`:

```yaml
npm_packages:
  - node-red-contrib-sun-position@2.0.0
```

This can be also used to go back to an older Version.

### 3.0.0-alpha: enhancement

Breaking changes:

- removed all "Radiant" angle selection from typed input. The standard selection (which was previous the decimal degree output) gives now an angle based on the type selection (degree or radiant) of the configuration node. Version number is changed to 3 to reflect these API changes.


This is still a non stable development version!!

Changes:

- general
  - first implementation of tests with `mocha` and some changes due to the test implementation (inject enhance and delay-until)
    - revised error handling and output messages if the configuration of nodes is not correct (missing config node, missing latitude/longitude).
  - added type checking
  - allow of custom sun position set and rise angles in the configuration node
  - allow of custom angles in the configuration node
  - removed the following angle selections (replaced by existing ones without rad):
    - time by azimuth (rad)
    - time by elevation (set or rise in rad)
    - next time by elevation (set or rise in rad)
    - next rise time by elevation (rad)
    - next set time by elevation (rad)
  - sun-times and moon-times have now every angle in Radians and Degree

- inject enhance (time-inject)
  - added repletely inject with CRON expression
  - added automatic test case
    - basic inject
    - time based inject

- within-time-switch
  - changed state output in case time span is over midnight, because the shown times could be not correct #416

  - reworked value caching mechanism; fixed bug #434

- blind-control

  - added for oversteer blind position the possibility to select msg property, flow or global context #423
    - This has some limitations. Changes would only have effect if the oversteer are evaluated.
  - fix not working oversteer mode limitation #431
  - implemented optional alternative azimuth input like node-red-contrib-blindcontroller #430

- time-comp
  - better adjustable of next time, fixes #420

### 2.0.0: enhancement

⚠ Warning: This Version could break existing flows. Please check your configuration!

🛑 Nodes (especially blind, time-control nodes) that were created or saved with this version do not work in older versions of the package. This affects the export / import of flows and when switching to an older version. It is therefore __essential__ to create a __backup__ before upgrading to this version!

- general
  - added only even and only odd weeks
  - added css property to moonPhases object an using css from [here](https://github.com/Paul-Reed/weather-icons-lite/blob/master/css_mappings.md)
  - for offset values of a random number a cached value will be used which will be only generated once per day. #302
  - selection of random number is available in more places
  - allow negative altitudePercent #259

- time-inject
  - fixed error if only flow/global context is set #252
  - fixed missing interval multiplier

  - nodes have now always 2 outputs - may breaks existing flows!
    - First output is configurable.
  - redesigned rule conditions, now unlimited conditions could be defined
  - additional nodeID which will be also in the output (if set will override nodeId)
    - added as rule condition operator - usable in subFlows
  - No more messages are sent at the first output if the rule has changed but the payload (level/slat) has remained the same.
    - A message will be sent if the topic has changed.
  - overwrite will be written to node context and restored on recreation - allows overwrite be stable on deploy #300
  - No longer configuration of number of outputs. Node will always have two outputs
    - The message send to the first output will no longer be send on rule change, only on level/payload changes.
    - The message on the first output is fully configurable.
    - A property can be setup to be a string with placeholders. (The same placeholders can be used for the topic.):
      - blind-control
        - `%name%` - name of the node
        - `%id%` - ID of the node
        - `%level%` - level
        - `%levelInverse%` - level, but inverse
        - `%slat%` slat position
        - `%code%` - node.reason.code,
        - `%state%` - node.reason.state,

        - `%payload%` - `msg.payload` of the incoming (trigger) message (if available)
      - clock-timer
        - `%name%` - name of the node
        - `%id%` - ID of the node
        - `%code%` - node.reason.code
        - `%state%` - node.reason.state

  - The name of the node (or the id if no name is given in the config) can be configured in the output message - #238
    - this information will be send as `msg.payload.name` to the second output
  - ID of the node can be send
    - this information will be send as `msg.payload.id` to the second output if two outputs are configured
  - blind-control only changes
    - redesigned oversteer, now unlimited oversteer can defined
    - oversteer can be defined only valid for special mode
    - removed minimum altitude settings
      - for functionality the downward compatibility is given by automatic adoption of the setting as new first oversteer, which has the same effect.
      - no longer specific output of the reason (instead of "below the minimum elevation angle" will output "oversteer 1")
    - window settings as typedInput, which allow to use from flow, global context or environment - node can better used in a subFlow
    - per message set mode will be written to node context and to thus this will be stable on deploy
      - needs to delete values of context on change
    - current mode will no longer part of the node label/name, it will be displayed in the node state #321
    - added option to setup a rule which prevents the node to send anything out #280

- *time compare and change* + *time span*

- blind control
  - fixed #61 by removing misleading angle
  - fixed #62 `setMode` can now deactivate sun control
  - added `resetOverwrite` additional property #54
  - add possibility to have a exact priority comparisons (e.g. only reset a specific priority)
  - redesigned rule input by dialog
  - removed previous reset option for level operator, will now be done by new special level type
  - added new type of Level: `NotDefined`, where for absolute rules default or sunControl will be used and for min/max the rule will be reset.
    - This will allow to have only one type of time rules (until/from) which could cover whole day.
    - Hopefully this makes rules easier.
  - added per rule two different times and two different conditions
    - allows to define more scenarios
    - allows to reduce amount of needed rules.
