This is a ultimate (Swiss-Army-Knife) Node-Red Timer based flow control with dusk, dawn (and variations) and much more.
Additional you can get sun and moon position or to control a flow by sun or moon position. It is ideal for usage of control smart home, but also for all other time based flow control.
There is also a roller [blind control](https://github.com/rdmtc/node-red-contrib-sun-position/wiki/blind-control) node and a [clock timer](https://github.com/rdmtc/node-red-contrib-sun-position/wiki/clock-timer) node. The [blind control](https://github.com/rdmtc/node-red-contrib-sun-position/wiki/blind-control) node can determine the position of the roller shutter by time or position of the sun. The [timer](https://github.com/rdmtc/node-red-contrib-sun-position/wiki/clock-timer) can send different payloads depending on the time.

## Information on Version changes

If a Node has a warning sign on the label like this one:
![warning sign](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12692680/81336350-7977f980-90a9-11ea-8d14-fa412b83fe45.png)
This is not an error, it hides only that the node needs to be opened, saved and deployed to fix the label.

âš  Nodes that were created or saved with a version 2.0.0 or later do not work in versions prior 2.0.0 of the package.

## Preconditions

These nodes need at least NodeJS Version __12.0__ and Node-Red with Version __1.2.9__! Any early Version of Node-Red will not work!

## Installation

`npm install node-red-contrib-sun-position`

## General

### Saving resources

The nodes are designed to do not calculate time events with every arriving message or with an interval every x time. This is to be able to handle a huge amount of messages also on even on computers with low resources.

### second based accuracy

The nodes are designed to be accurate to seconds. This means it was designed to turn on/off at exact given second. Other timers often work using intervals where they check your schedule only once a minute or even less. This means when you want something to come on at 08:00am, it may actually not come on until 30 seconds later. This nodes does not have this problem, it will come on at exactly 08:00:00am.
